# Malware Analysis

This repository will store all my analysis on real-world malwares.

Primary source of malware will be virusshare.

I will be using REMnux for static analysis and Flare VM for dynamic analysis.

All filename are the SHA256 value of the malware sample.

After downloading the malware sample from virusshare, I move the zip file to REMnux and extract it.
